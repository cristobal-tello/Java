1) We're going to create a Spring project using maven from scracthc.

I created this project using Eclipse. File->New->Maven Project. 
Make sure 'Create a simple project (skip archetype selection) is CHECKED. Click next and fill groupID, name...
Take a look the folders layout. These 'layout' is the standard for Maven projects.

2) On pom.xml we need to add spring libraries in order to use spring framework
Open pom.xml file, and you will see there are a few tab on the bottom of the file: "Overview", "Dependencies" ...
Select "Dependencies" tab. Click on Add button and search for "springframe"
You need to include spring-core, 4.0.6
