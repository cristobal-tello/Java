* Directory:
C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Apache Tomcat 8.0.27

Note (On Linux), make sure Java and Java JDK are already installed.
To install JDK in Ubuntu:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer

If you want to change the version, change the 8 by the version that you want



* Start Tomcat from Command line
Go to C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Apache Tomcat 8.0.27\bin and run startup.bat.
Then open http://localhost:8080/

* To configure Tomcat for its first use, start by opening the file conf/tomcat-users.xml in your favorite text editor. Place the following tag between the <tomcat-users>
</tomcat-users> XML tags (User will be 'admin' and password 'admin' as well):

<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
<user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui" />

* By default, Tomcat 8.0 compiles JavaServer Pages files with Java SE 6 language support even
if it runs on Java SE 8. These new Servlet init parameters instruct Tomcat to compile JSP
files with Java SE 8 language features, instead. Open the conf/web.xml file. Search the file for the text org.apache.jasper.servlet and add:
<init-param>
<param-name>compilerSourceVM</param-name>
<param-value>1.8</param-value>
</init-param>
<init-param>
<param-name>compilerTargetVM</param-name>
<param-value>1.8</param-value>
</init-param>

* DeployIng and UndeployIng applications in Tomcat

You can deploy and undeploy Java EE web applications in Tomcat. You have two options for accomplishing this:
a) Manually by placing the application in the webapps directory

Deploying an application manually on Tomcat is simple — just place the *.war file in Tomcat’s webapps directory. 
If Tomcat is running, within a few moments Tomcat should automatically unpack the application file into a directory with the same name minus the
.war extension. 

If Tomcat is not running, you can start it, and the application file will unpack as Tomcat starts. 

When the application has unpacked, open your browser and navigate to:

http://localhost:8080/war-deployment/ 

b) Using the Tomcat manager application

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/manager/html
Use the user and password that you previously set on "To configure Tomcat for its first use..."

Scroll down to the Deploy section and find the form “WAR file to deploy.” In the “Select WAR file to upload” field, choose the sample-deployment.war file from your filesystem.
When you click in OK, the WAR file uploads to Tomcat, which deploys the application. The sample-deployment directory is again created in Tomcat’s webapps directory.
